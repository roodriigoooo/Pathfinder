### pathfinder

a streamlit-based application to help students, parents and tutors find information about universities easily and transparently. 
it was built using official [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) data from the U.S. Department of Education, and it currently only includes data from the United States, and only for undergraduate studies. 
it also does not show narrowed-down, degree-specific data for a given institution, but rather analyzes and provides information of educating institutions as a whole. 

i would love to try to implement these things in the future, and any contributions are welcome.
